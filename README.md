# System-Design-Practice

A structured collection of High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD), and Design Patterns with examples, case studies, and quick reference notes. This repo is both a learning path and a personal reference for interviews and real-world projects.

## Repo Structure
system-design/

-> README.md

-> HLD/              → High-Level Designs & architectures

-> LLD/              → Low-Level Designs (class & sequence diagrams, OOP)

-> design-patterns/  → Creational, Structural, Behavioral patterns
    -> case-studies/     → Real-world system breakdowns (Netflix, Uber, etc.)

cheatsheets/      → Quick notes on DB, caching, scaling, API design

## Design Patterns (currently learning)
Creational

    Abstract Factory

    Builder

    Factory Method

    Prototype

    Singleton


Behavioural

    Command

    COR (Chain of Responsibility)

    Interpreter

    Iterator

    Mediator

    Memento

    Observer

    State

    Strategy

    Template

    Visitor


Structural

    Adapter

    Bridge

    Composite

    Decorator

    Facade

    Flyweight

    Proxy


## High-Level Design (HLD)
System requirements (functional & non-functional)

Architecture diagrams (monolith, microservices, event-driven)

Common systems:

    URL Shortener

    E-commerce System

    Chat Application

    Payment Gateway

Key concepts:

    Load Balancing, Caching, Partitioning, Replication
    CAP Theorem, Consistency vs Availability

## Low-Level Design (LLD)
Class diagrams & sequence diagrams

Detailed module interactions

Example problems:

    (TBI)

## Goals
Build a solid foundation in system design

Practice HLD + LLD for interviews & projects

Maintain a go-to reference for scaling systems
